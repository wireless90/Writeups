# Inline Function Hooking

Add a hook at the end of the pick_number function. The hook will print the return value of pick_number. You can save your hook at some_space function. Then, give this number as an input to the program in order to reveal the flag. Do not edit any other part of the program or try to reverse decrypt function.
