# I See You

Give the program the correct argument so it will print the flag by calling print_flag_if_has_permission. It is ok if the program crashes afterwards. Important: do not jump to decrypt in your ROP. Call print_flag_if_has_permission only from the beginning of the function. Do not reverse the decrypt function or modify the program.
